The RPI Sigfox board and Witty 2 board have conflicting requirements:

1. The RPI Sigfox board requires to disable the console via serial port (via raspi-config).  This effectively turns down the TXD port (as can be seen with gpio readall).

2. The Witty 2 board requires the TXD pin to be up.

However, there seems to be a workaround:

1. Disable the console on serial port via raspi-config
2. Reboot
3. Check that gpio readall shows 0 for the TXD pin
4. set enable_uart=1 in /boot/config.txt
5. Reboot
6. Check that the TXD pin is now up via gpio readall
7. Check that sending sigfox messages is still OK
8. Check that the witty 2 board works
9. Yay!

Also, make sure to add the user to the dialout group.
